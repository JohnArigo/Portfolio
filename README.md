<h1>Welcome to my Portfolio Website</h1>

I am a full stack developer with a strong focus on React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My portfolio website is a Single Page Application (SPA) that showcases my skills and experience as a developer.

The website is built using React and TypeScript, providing a smooth and responsive user experience. The website is also styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for easy customization and consistent styling throughout the site.

The website features a clean and modern design, highlighting my work and experience in a clear and concise manner. It also includes information about my skills and experience as a developer, as well as a way to contact me.

If you are interested in working with me or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for visiting my portfolio website!
